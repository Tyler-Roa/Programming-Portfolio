This is my programming portfolio! Here I will be attempting to showcase my coding abilities through previous projects of mine.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### JAVA: [Fibonacci](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/JavaChapters/Chapter%206/Fibbo.java)
![Example](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/images/prog%20fibbonaci%20ex.PNG)
This is a project that linearly calculates the fibonacci sequence a certain amount of times.


### JAVA: [Palindrome](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/JavaChapters/Ch13/BigIntPal.java)
![Example](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/images/palindrome%20ex.PNG)
This is a project that will calculate a random number, then continually add the numbers reversed until it hits a palindrome. (a number the same backwards as forwards.)
