## Welcome to my Programming Portfolio

This is my programming portfolio! Here I will be attempting to showcase my coding abilities through previous projects of mine.

### Markdown

### JAVA

> This was a big individual project that had me create something entirely new. Given an example of adding a dimension to a game, I chose to add another dimension to 2048, the popular internet game. It's unpolished, but it works.
[3D 2048](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/3D-2048)
[Example](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/images/3d%202048%20ex.png)

> This is a project that linearly calculates the fibonacci sequence a certain amount of times. [Fibonacci](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/JavaChapters/Chapter%206/Fibbo.java)
[Example](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/images/prog%20fibbonaci%20ex.PNG)

> This is a project that will calculate a random number, then continually add the numbers reversed until it hits a palindrome. (a number the same backwards as forwards.) [Palindrome](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/JavaChapters/Ch13/BigIntPal.java)
[Example](https://github.com/Tyler-Roa/Programming-Portfolio/blob/main/images/palindrome%20ex.PNG)
